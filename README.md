# A Friendly Introduction to R!

Welcome! :tada:

Danielle and Lilly are here to give you a very Friendly Intro to R. This is loosely based on a [basic R](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Rstats_4_n00bs) session we did at the 2016 PMCB retreat.

## About us
[Lilly Winfree](https://twitter.com/lilscientista) is a Science and Data Analyst at the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/) based at OHSU. She has a PhD in neuroscience and she works with the Monarch Initiative bioinformatics team to derive biological stories from the data and then communicates those stories to the world through talks, articles, and sometimes [fun tweets](https://twitter.com/MonarchInit/status/843948869385838592)!

[Danielle Robinson](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) is a [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships) who works with scientists, libraians, and non profits like [Code for Science](https://codeforscience.org/) to advance open data. She has a PhD in neuroscience and is working on a metadata manifesto.

## About the workshop
This is an aproximately 45 minute code-along workshop.

### Learning outcomes
1. Download and install R Studio
2. Become comfortable with the R Studio interface
3. Import a dataset into R studio
4. Learn to use R for basic exploratory data analyis and data visualizaiton 
5. Discuss future directions - what do *you* want to learn next?

### Let's get started!
Start with the Friendly-Intro.Rmd file, that's our presentation with some R basics and resources.

Then download the data from "example_lengths_for_R.csv" move on to the exercises in "BasticStatsCode.Rmd"

"Power_Analysis.Rmd" and "ANOVA.Rmd" are extra files we may or may not get to.
