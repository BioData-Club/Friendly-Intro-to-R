# A Friendly Introduction to R!

## :tada: Welcome! :tada:

This workshop is designed for R beginners. **If you've never coded before - you are in the right place!** If you have coded before, we may draft you to help out. Please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/BioData-Club/Friendly-Intro-to-R/issues) to give us feedback or let us know what you want to learn next.  This is loosely based on a [basic R](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Rstats_4_n00bs) session we did at the 2016 PMCB retreat.

## About us
[Lilly Winfree](https://twitter.com/lilscientista) is a Science and Data Analyst at the [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org/) based at OHSU. She has a PhD in neuroscience and she works with the Monarch Initiative bioinformatics team to derive biological stories from the data and then communicates those stories to the world through talks, articles, and sometimes [fun tweets](https://twitter.com/MonarchInit/status/843948869385838592)!

[Danielle Robinson](https://twitter.com/daniellecrobins) is a [Mozilla Fellow for Science](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/fellowships) who works with scientists, libraians, and non profits like [Code for Science](https://codeforscience.org/) to advance open data. She has a PhD in neuroscience and is working on a metadata manifesto.

## About the workshop
This is an aproximately 45 minute code-along workshop.

### Learning outcomes
1. Download and install R Studio
2. Become comfortable with the R Studio interface
3. Import a dataset into R studio
4. Learn to use R for basic exploratory data analyis and data visualizaiton
  - Determine mean, median
  - Run a t-test
  - Run an ANOVA
  - Create histograms and other basic data visulizations
5. Discuss future directions - what do *you* want to learn next?

### Let's get started!
Start with the [Friendly-Intro.Rmd](https://github.com/BioData-Club/Friendly-Intro-to-R/blob/master/Friendly-Intro.Rmd) file, that's our presentation with some R basics and resources.

Then download [example_lengths_for_R.csv](https://github.com/BioData-Club/Friendly-Intro-to-R/blob/master/example_lengths_for_R.csv) to your machine. 

From there, you'll move on to the exercises in [BasticStatsCode.Rmd](https://github.com/BioData-Club/Friendly-Intro-to-R/blob/master/BasicStatsCode.Rmd).

[Power_Analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/BioData-Club/Friendly-Intro-to-R/blob/master/Power_Analysis.Rmd) and [ANOVA.Rmd](https://github.com/BioData-Club/Friendly-Intro-to-R/blob/master/ANOVA.Rmd) are extra files we may or may not get to.
