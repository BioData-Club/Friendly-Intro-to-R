# A Friendly Introduction to R!

Welcome! :tada:

Danielle and Lilly reach a very Friendly Intro to R. This is loosely based on a [basic R](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Rstats_4_n00bs) session we did at the 2016 PMCB retreat.

This is an aproxiamtely 45 minute code-along workshop.

Start with the Friendly-Intro.Rmd file, that's our presentation with some R basics and resources.

Then download the data from "example_lengths_for_R.csv" move on to the exercises in "BasticStatsCode.Rmd"

"Power_Analysis.Rmd" and "ANOVA.Rmd" are extra files we may or may not get to.
