# Rstats_4_n00bs
DR and LW make a plan to teach the n00bs some simple analysis in R in a 45 minute code-along workshop.

Start with the Intro.Rmd file, that's our presentation with some R basics and resources.

Then download the data from "example_lengths_for_R.csv" move on to the exercises in "BasticStatsCode.Rmd"

"Power_Analysis.Rmd" and "ANOVA.Rmd" are extra files we did not get to.
